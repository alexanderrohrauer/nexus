# MDE YellowPages

This repository includes the source code for the prototype _Nexus_ of my Bachelor's thesis "MDE YellowPages" at the Institut f√ºr Wirtschaftsinformatik - Software Engineering at the University of Linz.

## Installation
1. Install Docker
2. If cached example-data is needed you can copy the *.sqlite cache files from `caches` folder into the `app` folder of this repository
3. Make sure, nothing runs on ports 3000, 8000 and 27017
4. Run `docker compose up -d`
5. After the startup was complete (~10sec), you can access the UI at `http://localhost:3000` and the REST-API at `http://localhost:8000`

The OpenAPI REST-API documentation is available at `http://localhost:8000/docs`

## Load example-data
1. Run `./import-example-data.sh` (after marking the file as executable)
2. After the process has finished (you can see this information in the container logs of the backend), you can do the next step
3. Run `curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/import-task/run-duplicate-detection"` for duplication-detection. This may take a while depending on the amount of data imported in the first step.
4. After the process has finished (you can see this information in the container logs of the backend), you can do the next step
5. Run `curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/import-task/run-duplicate-elimination"`. This may take a while depending on the amount of data imported in the first step.
6. Any duplicates which require manual duplicate elimination can be filtered in the Overview visualization with the filter set to `duplication_key not equals null`
